São Tomé, or the full name, the Democratic Replublic of São Tomé and Príncipe, is a small island country in the gulf of Guinea.
To most people who come from asian countries, it's a small country that is rarely heard of. I had the opportunity to work as a general physician there for 9 months. Here are some selected stories of my days on the lovely island.
