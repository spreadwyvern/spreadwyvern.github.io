## Where is São Tomé and Príncipe? What did the Medical Mission do there?

![Saturday market in STOP](/assets/images/market.jpg)

I bet most people in Asia and America never heard of the country São Tomé and Príncipe. Below is the slides of a little talk I gave to briefly introduce the little island and what my works there would be before setting out on my journey there. Interestingly enough, at the time I gave the talk, I had never set foot on São Tomé before.

(The talk was meant for the Portuguese class, so it's in Portuguese.)
