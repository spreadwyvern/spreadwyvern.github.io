_I'm a medical doctor, yet instead of practicing clinical medicine, I devoted my knowledge to improve medicine with artificial intelligence._

I'm one of the luckiest medical doctors in Taiwan that has several precious and decisive experiences during my medical career.

In February, 2014, during my clerkship, I had a chance to visit the Neurosurgery Department of Massachusetts General Hospital as a visiting student. There I actively participated in teams with talented surgeons, ward run at 5:30 am in the morning, left the hospital after the last operation, sometimes latet than 9 pm. Veiwed dozens of surgeries in one month, what impressed me most were not only the outstanding surgeons, but also the degree of quality a well-equipped department can provide treatments and care to patients. For neurosurgeons, the usage of medical images is intense, and Mass General has intra-operative CT and MR imaging operating rooms, which make neurosugeries more accurate and thorough.

During the Post-Graduate-Year residency in Taipei Veterans General Hospital, I targeted radiology as my future career. Medical imaging is one of the infrasturctures of modern medicine, and its importance in clinical decisions has been on the increase. I chose radiology as my elective one month rotation, through which I obtained more insights in interpreatation of various forms of medical images, experienced the busy radiological interventions and cared post-neurovascular-intervention patients.

After completed Post-Graduate-Year training, I volunteered to serve as a general physician in the Medical Mission of Taiwan in the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe. There I provided free clinics for local people and also assisted in free surgeries. The lack of specialists and medical resources make treating patients a difficult task. It was then I realized that though we have such advanced medicine and technology in developed countries, the scarcity of medical personnels render them futile. 

Back in Taiwan from a year of deployment, I started to take interest in improving healthcare with informatics. With the thrive of artificial intelligence in recent years, I believe the future of medicine relies heavily upn it. Through the deployment of this technology in the field, the difficulty of insufficiency of medical specialists in rural sites can also be tackled with.

I first lectured myself of data analysis and machine learning with online courses. Then in late 2017 I got a position as a research assistant in Digital Insights Research Lab in the Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica. My team consisted of marvelous researchers from different specialties, electrical engineering, biomedical technology, medicine. Together we work on several projects in implementation of artificial intelligence: machine learning and neural networks in medicine.
