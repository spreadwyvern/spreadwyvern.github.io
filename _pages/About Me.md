# About Me

I think I'm one of the luckiest medical doctors in Taiwan that has several precious and decisive experiences during my medical career.

In February, 2014, during my clerkship, I had a chance to visit the Neurosurgery Department of Massachusetts General Hospital as a visiting student. There I actively participated in teams with talented surgeons, ward run at 5:30 am in the morning, left the hospital after the last operation, sometimes latet than 9 pm. Veiwed dozens of surgeries in one month, what impressed me most were not only the outstanding surgeons, but also the degree of quality a well-equipped department can provide treatments and care to patients. For neurosurgeons, the usage of medical images is intense, and Mass General has intra-operative CT and MR imaging operating rooms, which make neurosugeries more accurate and thorough.
