## Abstract
With the advancement of neuroimaging, nowadays we have various modalities of neuroimages. New technique in magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides us with more detail informations regarding the white matter. Numerous studies had focused on assessment of pathology and degeneration of whitematter with DTI. 
We implemented state-of-the-art deep learning method with convolutional neural neworks to assess normal aging in healthy indivisuals. The trained neural network then has the potential to detect early neurodegeneration in patients.
