## Real Time Detection of Kidney in Ultrasound
This is a side project of the submitted "Kidney Function Classification and Prediction Through Ultrasound-based Kidney Imaging: From Deep Learning to Mass Screening of Chronic Kidney Disease".
The goal is to accelerate the process of predicting renal function in clinical practice by minimizing the time required to preprocess the raw image.
Below is a video shot by a cell phone of real time detection of kidney in ultrasound. The video is obtained by my friend Dr. Yu while he performed the sonography on himself.
